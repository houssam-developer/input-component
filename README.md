## Overview

This input component page can be found here: "https://input-component-he.netlify.app/".
Thanks to that challenge, I learn to work efficiently in order to succeed.
And I hope to make more beautifuls websites and become an expert in front-end developmemt :)

### Built With

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/TSqutYM4c5WtluM7QzGp) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

Challenge: Create a reusable input with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states. You can work on the same project with other design system challenges. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

- User story: I can see error state
- User story: I can choose to disable input
- User story: I can choose to have helper text
- User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
- User story: I can have different input sizes
- User story: I can have different colors
- User story: I can choose to have input take the width of the parent
- User story: I can have multiline input like a textarea
- User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- User story: I can still access all input attributes
- User story (optional): Show input in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the input in multiple states is enough
